However, building complex applications often\nrequires more than just the primitives provided by Svelte Runes.\n\nRuned takes those primitives to the next level by providing:\n\n- **Powerful Utilities**: A set of carefully crafted utility functions and classes that simplify\n  common tasks and reduce boilerplate.\n- **Collective Efforts**: We often find ourselves writing the same utility functions over and over\n  again. Runed aims to provide a single source of truth for these utilities, allowing the community\n  to contribute, test, and benefit from them.\n- **Consistency**: A consistent set of APIs and behaviors across all utilities, so you can focus on\n  building your projects instead of constantly learning new APIs.\n- **Reactivity First**: Powered by Svelte 5's new reactivity system, Runed utilities are designed to\n  handle reactive state and side effects with ease.\n- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support to catch errors early and provide a better developer\n  experience.\n\n## Ideas and Principles\n\n#### Embrace the Magic of Runes\n\nSvelte Runes are a powerful new paradigm. Runed fully embraces this concept and explores its\npotential. Our goal is to make working with Runes feel as natural and intuitive as possible.\n\n#### Enhance, Don't Replace\n\nRuned is not here to replace Svelte's core functionality, but to enhance and extend it. Our\nutilities should feel like a natural extension of Svelte, not a separate framework.\n\n#### Progressive Complexity\n\nSimple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. Runed provides easy-to-use\ndefaults while allowing for advanced customization when needed.\n\n#### Open Source and Community Collaboration\n\nRuned is an open-source, MIT licensed project that welcomes all forms of contributions from the\ncommunity. Whether it's bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions, your input will help\nmake Runed the best it can be.\n",
