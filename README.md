# Melt Next

Next generation of Melt UI.

Focus on simplicity and flexibility. Ships builders, but also components powered by builders.
Use `asChild` to get complete control over the component and its elements.
Alternatively, just use the returned builder instance from the component.

Controlled usage in builders, in components, everywhere.

This is not an agnostic implementation. Let's leverage the best of runes.

Keep it simple. No super advanced examples or extra features. Just well documented components.
The future comes afterwards.

## TODO

- [ ] Auto API reference for builders
- [ ] Auto API reference for components
- [ ] Auto changelog (?)
- [ ] Tests for utilities
- [ ] Tests for components
- [ ] Good docs structure
- [ ] Automatically check if returned types are valid HTML attributes
- [ ] Component JSDoc with @component
